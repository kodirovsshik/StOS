build fails on nasm 2.14.smth due to not being able to assemble 
	mov dword seg:[addr], value 
which is a correct instruction

Required apt packages: bochs bochs-x bochsbios vgabios
Or bochs compiled by oneself with all necessary features enabled

Bochs runs into triple fault when uses the default bochsbios 
from apt but works just fine when run with bios present as 
a part of manually compiled emulator with othewise similar settings.
I don't get it.
